<h3>Plot1: Scatter</h3>

<div id="plot1">

    </div>
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="plot_1" class="center_plot">
     <div id="explaination" > This is a scatter plot. The x axis is the type of movie, the y axis is the released year. I applied d3.zoom and tooltip on this scatter plot, which allows audiences to zoom in and see the name of the movie </div>
     <br>
     <div id="explaination" >  i: I chose one single color to represents each movie because it is categorical.  
        ii: Channels: Horizontal position, Vertical position.  Marks: points
     </div>
     <h4>Storytelling:</h4>
     <div id="explaination" >  This scatter plot demonstrates the type of movies/shows that exist in the dataset and which
        year it is produced.  <br />It is easy to see which category of movies/ shows are being produced most across all the years. <br />
        The empty space in the scatter plot indicates that some types of shows/movies were not reproduced in certain years.

<h3>Plot 2: Bar Chart</h3>
 <div id="plot_q2" class="center_plot">
    <div id="explaination" > This is a bar Chart. The x axis is the type of movie, the y axis is the amount of each type. I applied interactivities of bottons and animetion on this bar chart. </div>
    <br>
    <div id="explaination" >  i: I chose one single color to represents each type of movie because it is categorical.  <br />
       ii: Channels: Horizontal position, Verical position.  Marks: rectangles <br /> <br />
       This bar chart shows the amount of each category of movies and shows being produced. <br />
       The higher bars represent a larger amount of production of certain types of movies/shows and vice versa.<br />
        It helps the audience understand which type of movies/shows are more popular.

    <h3>Plot 3: Stacked Bar Chart</h3>
    <div id="explaination" > This is a stacked bar Chart. The x axis is the countries, the y axis is the amount of movie/shows.  <br />
    <br>
     i: I chose one single color to represents each type of movie because it is categorical.   <br />
       ii: Channels: Horizontal position, Verical position, Color, length of each segment.  Marks: lines  <br /> <br />
       This is a stacked bar chart. The different colors represent the two kinds of media(tv shows and movies).   <br />
       The stacked bar chart shows the amount of two types of media across countries. I made some changes based on my original proposal. <br /> 
       I was planning on setting the x axis to be directors. However, it seems like most of the directors only have one work, thus the stacked bar chart seems meaningless. <br />
        I adjusted the x axis to be countries, which can shows a more obvious relationship between country and amount of each type of media. <br />

    <h3>Plot 4: GeoMap</h3>
    <div id="explaination" > This is a Geomap. It shows ammount of production from each countries.  </div>
    <br>
    <div id="explaination" >  i:  The color scheme is d3.scaleSequential(d3.interpolatePurples) because the sata is sequential.<br />
       ii: Channels: color,Location  Marks: color-coded areas<br /><br />

This is a geomap. The different colors indicate the total number of shows and movies being produced in each country.<br />
 It provides a strong visual representation to the audiences. The darker the color, the larger the amount is.

    <h3>Plot 5: Box Plot</h3>
    <div id="plot_q4" class="center_plot"></div>
    <div id="explaination" > This is a Boxplot. It shows how released year of movie/show distributed.  </div>
    <br>
    <div id="explaination" >  i:  The color scheme is single color because it is categorical. <br />
       ii: Channels: position, length, width, color  Marks: lines <br /><br />
       This is a box plot of released years of movies and tv shows. I made some changes based on the original proposal: duration of shows and movies. <br />
       When i was doing the data cleaning i realized that there are multiple measure units for the duration. Some are in seasons, some are in episodes.<br />
        It is hard to standardize the units, so I started to look for the relationship between release year and kinds of media. <br />
        This box plot gives the audience a general idea of the distribution of release years. <br />
